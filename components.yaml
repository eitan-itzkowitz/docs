        **Effective Date Rules:**
        - If no `effectiveDate` is set, the tax rate is assumed to be effective as of `createdAt`.
        - If multiple tax rates have overlapping `effectiveDate` ranges, all applicable rates will be considered.
        - If `effectiveDate` is in the future, the tax rate will not be applied until that date.
        - Effective date ranges are inclusive of both start and end bounds.
        - If a tax rate is superseded by another, the superseding rate takes precedence.
